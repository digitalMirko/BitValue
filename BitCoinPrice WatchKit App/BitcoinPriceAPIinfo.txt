CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index API

CoinDesk provides a simple API to make its Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data programmatically available to others. You are free to use this API to include our data in any application or website as you see fit, as long as each page or app that uses it includes the text “Powered by CoinDesk”, linking to our price page. We'd also appreciate if you could email us at index@coindesk.com to let us know about your service and how you're using the CoinDesk BPI. CoinDesk data is made available through a number of HTTP resources, and data is returned in JSON format. Please do not abuse our service.
BPI real-time data

On the CoinDesk website, we publish the BPI in USD, EUR, and GBP, calculated every minute, based on criteria as discussed on the CoinDesk BPI page. This same data can be retrieved using the endpoint:
