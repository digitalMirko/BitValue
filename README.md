# BitValue
Xcode 8.2.1 under Swift 3

### Apple Watch Bit Coin Price App that gives you the current price of Bit Coins Value.

First launch the app.

You are greeted by a gold Bit Coin image. Below it is where the current value of Bit Coins are shown in U.S. Dollar value.
If this is the first time you've used the app all you will see is the Bit Coin image with text in the very bottom
saying "Updating...". Then after a few seconds you will see the most current Bit Coin value in U.S. Dollar format apear under
the Bit Coin image with the "Updating..." line changed to "Updated".

The Compilation Controller has been setup to work with this app in the small and large Modular sections.
So if you have it enabled for the app you will see the Bit Coin information there too. If you have it setup
as your home screen with the various Compilations showing you can also access the app from that screen too.
By simply tapping on either of the enabled Bit Coin screens you will be transported back into the app.

Everytime the app runs it shows the most current Bit Coin Value in U.S. Dollar format.

The Bit Coin data is generated via JSON from Coin Desk
Bit Coin Price API used: https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json
